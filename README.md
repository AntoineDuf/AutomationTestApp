# AutomationTestApp
This is a technical test for an automation company.

The project consists to display home devices with a steering page for each device.

 1. Requirements :
 - must support iOS 14, with MVVM architecture, Multilanguage support.
 - have dedicated class for each device.
 - data need to be fetch from a json file.
 - project must be in full code -> no storyboards.
 - keep the devices update in the app life cycle with visual update.

**2. What i would improve with more time on this test :**
 - test all the coordinators.
 - add of CoreData or Realm to save data even after a restart of the app.
 - add RxSwift in the project.
 - add comment in the project.
 - improve UI (design).
 - investigate on "invalid mode 'kCFRunLoopCommonModes'" error on log (it seems to be a log noise of UIKit).
